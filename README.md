> ⚠️ **Under active development.** Built with AI assistance — expect bugs and rough edges. Review, test, and harden before using with sensitive production data.

Nodexia is a single Go binary with no client-side framework: server-rendered
HTML (`html/template`), the Go standard-library HTTP server, and a tiny pinned
set of dependencies. It connects to your nodes over SSH, collects resource and
traffic metrics on a schedule, and surfaces them through monitoring, analytics,
forecasting, and alerting.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Monitoring & analytics** — CPU, RAM, swap, disk, load, and uptime per
  server, plus vnStat traffic (daily/monthly download & upload), charted from
  hourly/daily rollups.
- 🔮 **Bandwidth forecasting** — projects today / this-week / this-month download
  from history (the model adapts as more data arrives) with a confidence level.
- 🚦 **Monthly limits & days-to-exhaustion** — set an optional per-server download
  cap; the forecast flags if you'll exceed it and how many days are left.
- 🔔 **Alerting** — threshold and **predictive** rules (warn *before* a limit is
  hit) with cooldowns, silences, severity, history, and Telegram delivery — plus
  an optional periodic status digest.
- 🔍 **Node discovery** — detect and manage Rebecca / Pasarguard nodes, with a
  Pasarguard install wizard and a background scheduler for monitoring/discovery.
- 🌐 **Bilingual UI** — full English and Persian (فارسی) with RTL support;
  installable as a PWA.
- 🧰 **Supporting tools** — bulk reboot/update/delete, in-browser SSH terminal,
  command runner, SFTP browser, and encrypted backup/restore.
- 🔒 **Security** — single admin, HMAC-signed CSRF-protected sessions, login rate
  limiting, SSH host-key pinning, and runtime-only SSH credentials.

## 🚀 Production install

Nodexia runs as a Docker Compose stack behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
(automatic HTTPS). `install.sh` handles everything on a fresh Ubuntu host:
installs Docker, deploys to `/opt/nodexia`, generates secrets, builds the
containers, registers a systemd service, installs the `nodexia` management
command, and waits for the app to report healthy.

> ⚡ **Fast installs.** The installer downloads a prebuilt, statically linked
> binary from the matching [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Ho3einK84/Nodexia/releases)
> (verified by SHA-256) and bakes it into the image — turning a ~100 s source
> compile into a sub-second build. It transparently falls back to building from
> source when no release binary exists for the target version/architecture, or
> when you pass `--build-from-source`.

**Prerequisites**

- Ubuntu 24.04 with root/sudo (only 24.04 is tested)
- A domain with a DNS `A` record pointing at the server's public IP
- Inbound TCP **80** + **443** open
- ≥ 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ho3einK84/Nodexia.git
cd Nodexia
sudo ./install.sh --domain panel.example.com --email you@example.com
```

The installer prompts for an admin username/password, then prints the panel URL
and credentials once it's healthy. Add `--non-interactive` for an unattended run
(random admin password printed once at the end).

**Common flags**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--domain <host>` | Public hostname (required for a new install) |
| `--email <addr>` | ACME / Let's Encrypt contact |
| `--admin-user` / `--admin-password` | Admin login (preserved on rerun unless set) |
| `--telegram-bot-token <token>` | Enable Telegram alert delivery |
| `--image-version <tag>` | Release to deploy — a tag (e.g. `v0.2.0`) or `latest` |
| `--build-from-source` | Always compile from source; skip prebuilt binaries |
| `--non-interactive` | Never prompt; auto-generate missing values |
| `--skip-dns-check` / `--skip-port-check` | Skip preflight checks |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show all options |

**What it creates:** `/opt/nodexia` (source + Compose),
`/opt/nodexia/.env.production` (secrets, `chmod 600`), the `nodexia.service`
systemd unit, the `nodexia` CLI at `/usr/local/bin/nodexia`, and the
`nodexia_data` (SQLite + pinned host keys) and `caddy_data` (TLS certs) volumes —
all persist across updates.

---

## 🧭 Managing Nodexia

The installer adds a `nodexia` command that wraps the Compose stack (it uses
`sudo` automatically when needed):

```bash
nodexia status      # show container status
nodexia logs        # follow logs (add a service name, e.g. `nodexia logs app`)
nodexia up          # start the stack
nodexia down        # stop the stack
nodexia restart     # restart the stack (or one service)
nodexia update      # pull the latest version and redeploy
```

**Update**

```bash
nodexia update                          # redeploy the configured version
nodexia update --image-version v0.2.0   # upgrade to a specific release
nodexia update --image-version latest   # upgrade to the newest release
```

`nodexia update` re-runs the installer non-interactively: it refreshes the
source, re-downloads the prebuilt binary, and redeploys while preserving your
existing secrets. The classic path still works too — `cd /opt/nodexia && git
pull && sudo ./install.sh`.

> 🛠️ **Manual / non-Ubuntu:** `cp .env.production.example .env.production`, edit
> it, then `docker compose -f compose.production.yml up -d --build`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is environment-based — the full annotated list lives in
[`.env.production.example`](.env.production.example). Edit
`/opt/nodexia/.env.production` and run `sudo systemctl restart nodexia` to apply.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `NODEXIA_AUTH_USERNAME` / `NODEXIA_AUTH_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Admin login. Empty or known-weak passwords are refused at production startup. |
| `NODEXIA_SESSION_SECRET` | ✅ | HMAC key for signed cookies; unique, ≥ 16 chars (`openssl rand -base64 48`). |
| `NODEXIA_DOMAIN` | ✅ | Public hostname; changing it re-issues certificates on restart. |
| `NODEXIA_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | — | Telegram bot token for alerts/digest; blank disables sending. |
| `NODEXIA_DB_DRIVER` / `NODEXIA_DB_DSN` | — | `sqlite` (default) or `mysql` + DSN. |
| `NODEXIA_SCHEDULER_MONITORING_INTERVAL` | — | Monitoring interval (default `15m`). |
| `NODEXIA_SCHEDULER_NODES_INTERVAL` | — | Node discovery interval (default `12h`). |
| `NODEXIA_DIGEST_ENABLED` | — | Enable the periodic Telegram status digest (default `false`). |
| `NODEXIA_DIGEST_INTERVAL` | — | Digest cadence when enabled (default `24h`). |
| `NODEXIA_DIGEST_CHANNEL` | — | Channel name to send the digest to; empty = every enabled channel. |
| `NODEXIA_SSH_HOST_KEY_POLICY` | — | `tofu` (default) or `insecure`. |

> 🔐 **Never commit or share `.env.production`** — it holds your admin password,
> session secret, and bot token. It's gitignored.

## 🔔 Alerting & digest

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy its token.
2. Set `NODEXIA_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and restart the stack.
3. In **`/alerts`**, add a channel (your chat ID), define rules (metric,
   threshold, severity, cooldown, consecutive hits), add silences as needed, and
   send a test message.

Without a token the alerts UI still records events — it just shows a "not
configured" notice instead of sending.

**Predictive metrics.** To use the forecast-derived alert metrics
(`projected_exceed_limit`, `days_to_exhaustion`), first set a **monthly download
limit** for the server on its analytics page (`/servers/{id}/analytics`). These
rules only apply once a limit is configured and enough history exists to project;
otherwise they are skipped that cycle (never falsely firing or resolving).

**Status digest.** Set `NODEXIA_DIGEST_ENABLED=true` (a bot token must be
configured) to receive a recurring summary every `NODEXIA_DIGEST_INTERVAL`. The
first digest is sent one interval after startup, never immediately.

## 💻 Local development

No Docker required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ho3einK84/Nodexia.git
cd Nodexia
cp .env.example .env          # set NODEXIA_AUTH_USERNAME / NODEXIA_AUTH_PASSWORD
go run ./cmd/nodexia/
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and sign in. Dev cookies aren't marked `Secure`, so
plain HTTP works.

## 🗄️ Data & retention

- **Database:** SQLite by default (MySQL supported via `NODEXIA_DB_DRIVER=mysql`).
  Schema and migrations live in [`schema.sql`](schema.sql) and are applied
  automatically on startup.
- **Raw system snapshots** are kept ~30 days, then **hourly rollups** (~6 months)
  and **daily rollups** (~2 years) become the authoritative time series.
- **Traffic snapshots** retain the latest ~35 days of daily vnStat rows (5 weeks)
  so the day-of-week seasonal forecast has enough samples per weekday, plus ~6
  months of monthly totals.

---

## 🧪 Build & test

```bash
make build    # → bin/nodexia
make test     # full test suite
go vet ./...  # static analysis
```

**Releases.** Pushing a version tag (e.g. `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin
v0.2.0`) triggers [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml),
which runs the tests, cross-compiles static `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
binaries, and publishes them (with `checksums.txt`) to a GitHub Release. The
installer then downloads the binary matching `--image-version` instead of
compiling on the target host.

> **Go version:** the project targets the **latest Go 1.25.x** patch, not a
> frozen one. The Docker base image (`golang:1.25`) and CI (`go-version: 1.25.x`)
> both float to the newest 1.25 patch automatically. The `go 1.25.0` line in
> `go.mod` is the **minimum** language version required — Go has no directive
> that auto-selects the latest patch, so building with any 1.25.x toolchain
> (1.25.0 or newer) is supported and no `toolchain` pin is added.
